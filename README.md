# TryIt Editor Desktop

This is a unofficial desktop version of w3school tryit editor developed for practicing html coding. I have plan for adding more features like file system or others with other programming facilities.

Firstly, install all dependencies with:

> yarn install

Then, run with command:

> yarn tauri dev

To build:

> yarn tauri build
